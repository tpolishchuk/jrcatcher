  Scenario: Add an existing endpoint
    When I add "app_1" endpoint
    Then an endpoint addition form should be hidden
    When I press "Add Listener" button
    Then an endpoint addition form should be shown
    When I add "app_1" endpoint
    Then errors alert should be displayed
    And errors list should match the following errors list
      | Given endpoint already exists |
